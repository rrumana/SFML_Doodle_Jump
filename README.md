# SFML-Doodle-Jump
A remake of Doodle Jump for PC, first C++ SFML game

I have a long way to go before this is finished, right now it is a bunch of stringy code that barely works. 
I'll do fine tuning and rename variables to be more user friendly in the future

The plan is to implement all of the images in the images file and most or all of the in game mechanics.
If I end up chosing to not use a certain aspect of the project, I'll delete it to reduce bulk once the game is nearing completion

One important thing to note, I do not own Doodle Jump, all of the credit goes to the creators of the game.
I am simply exploring SFML, playing with game mechanics, and working on a fun project.

Controls are as follows:

  Arrow keys or 'w' and 'd' keys for left and right movement.
  Up arrow or space bar to fire
